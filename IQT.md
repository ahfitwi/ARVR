# Luminance uniformity describes brightness being completely uniform in all 
   parts of a display, ensuring there are no dark spots or illegibility of 
  information on the screen.
  
# LED: How does LED work?
  
# LCOS: Liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS or LCOS)
LCoS was initially developed for projection televisions but is now used for wavelength selective switching, structured illumination, near-eye displays and optical pulse shaping. By way of comparison, some LCD projectors use transmissive LCD, allowing light to pass through the liquid crystal.

# OLED: An organic light-emitting diode (OLED),
Where an LED TV requires a backlighting setup to produce light, OLEDs don't. All this is possible due to specially constructed OLED diodes inheriting organic properties. When current is passed through these diodes, they produce light resulting in vivid picture quality.
